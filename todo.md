## Blocked on you

- [ ] You get a fresh `skills.tsv` that includes the fixes from audit passes
      9–16, and `deno task status` passes. Blocker: a multi-hour Ollama run on
      the Mac, and Ollama stays off for now. The last full build predates the
      April 17 fixes. `build/` holds only the committed caches. Decision:
      regenerate every LLM cache. Deleting `5_prereqs.tsv` applies the R1–R10
      and DR1 candidate fixes to every skill. Deleting the Haiku enrichment
      caches removes the ~10% wrong descriptions (E2) and applies the ENR1–4
      prompts.
  1. Golden diff of the split refactor, before you delete a cache: in worktrees
     at `46783a1` and `6044561`, run every stage but `enrich` with `SKIP_LLM=1`
     and the committed caches. The two `skills.tsv` files must match byte for
     byte.
  2. `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b`. The Mac has only `nomic-embed-text` today, so
     stages `enrich` and `prereq` stop on their first request.
  3. Smoke-test one prompt per `num_predict` (60, 120, 200, 600) with
     `curl localhost:11434/api/generate`. gpt-oss thinks before it answers, and
     the thinking counts against `num_predict`, so a short limit can return an
     empty `response`. If it does, raise that limit or send `think: "low"` in
     the `/api/generate` call of `resumableOllama` (lib.ts). `resumableOllama`
     stops a stage after 200 answers when over half come back rejected.
  4. `git rm build/1b_infill.tsv build/1c_summarize.tsv build/1d_onet_desc.tsv build/5_prereqs.tsv`.
  5. Run `deno run -A pipeline.ts enrich`. It also translates the MOOCCubeX
     labels into `build/1f_translate.tsv`; commit that cache. Stage `list` drops
     25k long titles today, because the summarize cache has only 3.4k rows and
     the OpenSALT description cache is empty.
  6. Run `deno run -A pipeline.ts`. Stage `seed-edges` runs after `dedupe` for
     the first time; watch its foundation-wiring count and quarantine.
  7. Stage `seed-edges` logs `cap dropped N pairs` when the 50000 OpenSALT
     grade-pair cap cuts. If it cuts, decide: raise the cap or throw.
  8. Stage `seed-edges` quarantines a whole source without a word. Set a floor
     per source from this run's resolved/total counts. Make the stage throw when
     a source resolves under its floor.
  9. Run `deno task status`. Write a todo entry for each condition below 1.0.
  10. Seed conditions: if `seed_anchor_conflicts` is high, look for unanchored
      seed chains longer than 20. Stage `difficulty` drops every pair of such a
      chain, where dropping the fewest would do. If `seed_cycle_pairs` is high,
      check the OpenSALT grade-order pairs across frameworks.
  11. `difficulty_raw` no longer holds the seed order; only `band` does. Check
      whether the status condition on reversed LLM picks and the candidate
      filter in stage `prereq` should read `band` instead of `raw`.

- [ ] Skills from every US state standard set appear in `skills.tsv`, merged
      with OpenSALT where they repeat. Decision: approved design. Common
      Standards Project (CSP) and ASN, everything they give, with no row bound.
      Blocker: the full CSP download runs for hours, and its size decides
      whether `data/csp/` is committed like `data/opensalt/` (107 MB) or
      gitignored. ASN bulk access needs your email request.
  1. CSP: `api.commonstandardsproject.com/api/v1` answers without a key today.
     It lists 785 jurisdictions: 65 state, 342 organization, 374 school, 4
     other. Texas alone has 729 standard sets.
  2. `data/download.ts` fetches each jurisdiction, then each standard set, into
     `data/csp/{setId}.json`. It skips files that exist, uses a 30 s timeout,
     and retries once.
  3. Example set record:
     `{"id": "…", "title": "Grade 3", "subject": "Mathematics", "educationLevels": ["03"], "jurisdiction": {"title": "Texas"}, "standards": {"<id>": {"statementNotation": "3.4.A", "description": "…", "depth": 2}}}`.
  4. ASN: only single documents download
     (`asn.desire2learn.com/resources/{id}_full.json`). Bulk needs the batch
     service (asn.desire2learn.com/content/asn-batch-service), so you must
     request it. CSP first imported its states from ASN, so ASN adds mostly
     duplicates.
  5. Stage `list` parses CSP standards like OpenSALT items: same scaffolding
     filters, `grade:*` tags from `educationLevels`, `sources: ["csp"]`, and
     `code:<statementNotation>`.
  6. Stage `dedupe` merges a CSP row and an OpenSALT row that carry the same
     `code:*` tag before the cosine pass.

- [ ] Delete the CSP API key from git history, or confirm that it is CSP's
      public demo key. Blocker: you. Commit `4724493^` holds a hardcoded
      `api-key` in `data/download.ts`, and `origin/main` already has that
      commit. A history rewrite changes every later commit hash.
  1. Check whether the key belongs to your CSP account.
  2. If yes: rotate it at CSP. The API answers without a key today, so new code
     sends none.
