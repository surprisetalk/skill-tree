- [x] stage 1: list (102k skills from ESCO/ONET/Lightcast/OpenSALT)
- [x] stage 1b: Lightcast description infill via Haiku batch (31,587)
- [x] stage 1c: Summarize 16k verbose OpenSALT/ONET standards via Haiku
- [x] stage 1d: Enrich 14,520 ONET Task/DWA descriptions via Haiku
- [x] stage 2: embed via Ollama nomic-embed-text
- [x] stage 3: tag occupations/topics via cosine+IDF + ESCO/ONET direct relations + occ-pair filter
- [x] stage 3b: dedupe near-identical skills via cosine + title Jaccard
- [x] stage 4: difficulty via OpenSALT grade anchors + within-topic kNN (uniform bands)
- [x] stage 5: prereq linking via Haiku 3 batch + ancestor candidates (resolved-id format)
- [x] stage 6: postproc (band-inversion filter + hub cap + onet:tech filter)
- [x] stage 7: finalize skills.tsv (101,630 skills, 307,763 edges, 5,177 roots)
- [x] HTML ladder visualization (viz.ts: top-N, seed, or --all modes)

## Quality pass 2 (2026-04-14)
- [x] slugify: decode HTML entities + word-boundary truncation + 6-hex hash for >80ch (no more `-amp-`, no more mid-word cuts, no `-2` collisions). Requires full re-run from stage 1 to take effect for existing cached IDs.
- [x] Seed edges override inferred difficulty (378 added vs 131 before, +188%). Cycle-breaker iter bumped 10→50.
- [x] P279 topic pollution filter: year/numeric blocklist + all-short-token junk filter. 211k pollution topics dropped; singleton topics dropped globally.
- [x] Dedupe stage 3b: token-sort signature pre-merge (859 additional merges from and/or/word-order swaps).
- [x] Tag backfill stage 3b: embedding-NN fills tags for untagged canonicals (1,918/4,230 enriched).
- [x] Drop dead `certs` column; emit `grade_start`/`grade_end` from existing `grade:XX` tags (0.1% → 22% coverage).

## Known limits (future work)
- [ ] 5-9% orphan rate — mostly peer-orphan leaves. Fix needs true topic hierarchy (Wikidata P279 etc.)
- [ ] Some occupation tags still reflect embedding bias more than truth (e.g. `computer-numerically-controlled-tool-operators` on generic skills)
- [ ] alcpl holdout recall 0.20 (up from 0.04); khan/moocx still 0 — LLM prereq inference misses most ground-truth edges. Try ensemble with rule-based or revised prompt.
- [ ] Full stage-1 re-run required to realize slugify fix (eliminates 13k truncated IDs, 176 `-2` dupes, HTML entity leaks).
- [ ] Topic "rome-officials-and-employees" and similar Wikipedia categories survive P279 filters — add co-occurrence sanity check.

## Ideas
- [ ] which skills are most valuable? use occupation salaries
- [ ] ucsd map of science visualization
- [ ] Wikidata P279 subclass hierarchy as parent-topic source
